AIAWRITE - Utility to Write AIA information - Version 1.0

Syntax:

    AIAWRITE group field1=[value1]..[fieldn=[valuen]]|/f=file,

where:

group   The name of the device group.
fieldn  The name of the field to write
valuen  The value to assign to fieldn.  For the USERDEVICE group,
        a blank value means delete this field, if the field already
        exists, or create a field with a NULL value if the field does
        not exist.  For all others it means assign a zero or null value.
file    Name of file to get field/value pairs from.  Each line in
        this file contains one field/value pair, separated by '='.  

***********************************************************************
AIAWRITE Utility Author Notes:

  1. All options, group and field names are case-insensitive except for
     the USERDEVICE group and the prefix.
  2. If you specify no options or incorrect options, then this help text
     is displayed if this file exists.  You may use the more command to 
     see it page by page:
           AIAWRITE |MORE
  3. There is an undocumented /d debug flag.  This may help if you get a
     failure and are not sure where it is comming from or what it means.
  4. You can specify either field/value pairs or the /f= option, but
     not both.
  5. You can add or remove a new NIC by chaning the size of NUMNICS.    
  7. If the value is a string, it must be surrounded by the double
     quote character '"' if there is a space in it and it is specified
     as a field=value command line option.  Double quotes are optional
     around string values specified in the file.
  8. When the AIA Information area is uninitialized (machine ships from 
     factory this way), you must write a group before AIAREAD will be 
     able to read it.  If you only want to initialize the group, but 
     don't want to write it, just write the group witout any field/value 
     pairs.  This will initialize all strings to '', all dates  and 
     numbers to zeros.

desired.
