Title: EDID Monitor Information
Description: This code displays Monitor information including Serial Number which is very useful when doing an asset management project. This information is provided through the EDID information contained in the monitor. I can not claim full credit for this code. I ported it from a vbscript the was heavily dependent on the use of WMI and Scripting components which I could not use in my Inventory Software. I just thought I would pass this usefully code along!!
