Description
===========

USBLogView is a small utility that runs in the background and records the
details of any USB device that is plugged or unplugged into your system.
For every log line created by USBLogView, the following information is
displayed: Event Type (Plug/Unplug), Event Time, Device Name,
Description, Device Type, Drive Letter (For storage devices), Serial
Number (Only for some types of devices), Vendor ID, Product ID, Vendor
Name, Product Name, and more...

You can easily select one or more log records and then export them into

Start Using USBLogView
======================

USBLogView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
USBLogView.exe

After running USBLogView, every time that a USB device is plugged or
unplugged from your system, a new log line with the details of the device
will be added to the main window of USBLogView. If you want to close the
main window without stopping the recording of USB devices information,
you can turn on the 'Put Icon On Tray' option, and then close the main
window of USBLogView.

You can also select one or more log lines in the main window of
USBLogView, and then copy the log data to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) or
export the log data into xml/html/csv/comma-delimited file (Ctrl+S)



Translating USBLogView to other languages
=========================================

In order to translate USBLogView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run USBLogView with /savelangfile parameter:
   USBLogView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named USBLogView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   USBLogView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run USBLogView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run USBLogView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
