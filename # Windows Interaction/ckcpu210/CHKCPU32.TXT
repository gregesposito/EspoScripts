    CPU Identification utility v2.10
    --------------------------------

Introduction
------------
After a CPU and/or motherboard upgrade, it can be difficult to find the
correct motherboard or BIOS settings for clockspeed and clock multiplier.
I wrote the CHKCPU32 utility to have an easy check on these settings.
On the other hand, CHKCPU32 is also useful for checking the CPU details on
a given machine. Due to its text-based or XML output, information from CHKCPU32
can easily be used to get CPU info from each machine in a network by calling
CHKCPU32 from the network log-on script or via a remote execution tool.

The program
-----------
The program comes in a ZIP-file (CKCPU210.ZIP) which should contain the
following 3 files: CHKCPU32.BAT  ;a batch file for easy use of the program
                   CHKCPU32.EXE  ;the program
                   CHKCPU32.TXT  ;this text file.
The files have a date-time stamp of 09/09/12 - 2:10 am.
The program is written in assembly language and it is freeware.

The CHKCPU32.EXE executable is a true Win32 console mode program. This
32-bit Windows version is the successor of the previous 16-bit DOS version.

CHKCPU32 is designed to run in the command window of any 32/64-bit Windows
version (Win95 or higher). Because CHKCPU32 is a true Windows program, it
doesn't suffer from the limitations of the previous 16-bit DOS version when
run under Windows. Especially under WinNT4 and later Windows versions, CHKCPU32
gives a better speed indication accuracy than the 16-bit CHKCPU.
In addition, CHKCPU32 can display the number of CPUs and Cores in a system.

To have a quick check on the CPU details, without opening a command window and
typing the required commands, unzip the CHKCPU32.BAT and CHKCPU32.EXE files in
a folder and double-click on the CHKCPU32.BAT file in explorer.


CHKCPU32 output examples
------------------------
On my Celeron M laptop, running Windows Vista, CHKCPU32 shows:

Apart from this 'Normal' display, CHKCPU32 supports command-line switches
to get another format or to display additional CPU information.
You can get a list of these switches with the command CHKCPU32 /? or /H
The following switches are supported:
- With CHKCPU32 /C you get the CPUID only mode. In this mode, any code that
  does more than CPUID data processing, like speed measurement, is skipped.
  So this mode works like a safe detection mode and can be used for
  troubleshooting problems when using CHKCPU32.
- With CHKCPU32 /D you get the Debug mode. It displays a dump of raw OS and
  relevant CPUID level information. Great for troubleshooting "Unknown"
  indications or getting info on new CPU models.
- With CHKCPU32 /F you get the Frequency mode. It displays the CPU Speed only.
  Intended for use in scripts. The output is in MHz but has no trailing 'MHz'.
- With CHKCPU32 /S you get a Short display of CPU Type and Speed only.
  Intended for use in network logon scripts. The output has no trailing CR.
- With CHKCPU32 /V you get the Verbose mode. It displays additional CPUID info
  like CPU features, Instruction set extensions, and the sizes of the L1 and
  integrated L2/L3 cache.
  Some CPU features are only displayed for specific CPUs. These are:
   'CPU Serial Number Enabled' for the PentiumIII,
   'Hyper-Threading technology', 'Execute Disable protection', '64-bit support'
   and 'Virtualization Technology' for the Pentium 4, Core (2), Athlon 64 and
   later models.
  The Instruction set extensions line displays if MMX, 3DNow, SSE, SSE2, SSE3,
  SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, and SSE4A support is present.
   Note that only supported instruction sets are displayed.
  For CPUs with split Data/Instruction L1 caches, the combined value is shown.
  On Multi-Core CPUs, the sizes of the L1 and L2 cache are indicated for each
  core and the number of caches per CPU package is indicated as well.
   Note that when a combined L2 cache is used by the CPU in question, the nbr
   of L2 caches present is less than the nbr of cores.
  A L3 cache, if present, is usually a single combined cache.
- With CHKCPU32 /X you get the XML mode. It displays CPU details in XML format.
  Intended for easy parsing of specific CPU data for use in another program.
  Most members in the XML output contain text strings. Exceptions are the
  <cpu_speed>, <physical_cpus>, <cores>, and <threads> members that contain
  decimal numbers and the <cpuid_sign> member that contains a hex number.
  In addition, all members that indicate a CPU feature or instruction set
  extension, like <htt>, <_64bit>, <mmx>, display only a single binary number.
  A '1' if the function is supported and a '0' if it is not.

Switches can be combined. Example: CHKCPU32 /S /C gives a short display of
the CPU type only. The speed is not displayed.
The /D switch has priority over the /V switch, the /S switch has priority over
the /D and /V switches, the /F switch has priority over the /S, /D, and /V
switches, the X switch has priority over the /F, /S, /D, and /V switches, and
the /H or /? switch has priority over all other switches.

CHKCPU32 /V under Windows 7 64-bit on my AMD Desktop box looks like:

CHKCPU32 is meant to be used on 586/Pentium or higher CPUs only. CPUs which
do not know the CPUID instruction are not supported by CHKCPU32.
In addition, CHKCPU32 relies solely on the TSC for CPU speed measurement.
CHKCPU32 recognizes CPUs from Intel, AMD, Cyrix/IBM, IDT, VIA, Rise,
and Transmeta.


Clock multiplier and CPU speed
------------------------------
Since the Intel 486DX2 hit the market, most CPUs run internally faster
than externally.
The Internal CPU speed display indicates the true internal CPU clock speed.
The internal CPU clock speed = Bus clock X Clock multiplier.
The Bus clock is the speed of the motherboard clock.
On Pentium class CPUs, the clock multiplier is usually selectable in steps
of 0.5 (x1.5, x2, x2.5, x3 etc.).
Some CPUs have a fixed multiplier factor (Celeron, PentiumIII/4), and some
use fractional factors like x1.75 (K5) or x2.33 (Winchip-2A).
Modern CPUs (Athlon64/Pentium4) use whole numbers as multiplier factor.

For Intel CPUs the internal speed equals the rating. So a Pentium 200 will
run internally at 200 MHz. (66.6 x 3)
For AMD, Cyrix, and Rise CPUs the internal speed can be lower than the PR
rating due newer and more efficient design.
For the K6-2 and later AMD CPUs upto 1400MHz, the internal speed equals the
rating but modern CPUs use a performance figure as rating.

CHKCPU32 measures the CPU speed by accurately timing the increment of the
CPU's internal Time Stamp Counter (TSC). As a timebase, the Windows own
PerformanceCounter is used which in turn is based on one of the motherboard's
hardware timers.
Under Windows there is always a chance of a Task-switch, and if this occurs
during CPU speed measurement, the result would be highly inaccurate.
To ensure an accurate speed reading, CHKCPU32 uses a short as possible
timebase interval and re-starts the speed measurement from scratch if a
Task-switch does occur during that time interval.
This retry is allowed for up to ten times, to maximize the chances on a good
speed measurement.


Other display details
---------------------
The 'System CPU count' display indicates the hardware topology of enabled
logical processors in the system on 3 levels:
 1) Number of physical CPU packages
 2) Number of Cores per CPU package
 3) Total number of logical processors (=Threads).
Without Hyper-Threading, the number of logical processors is equal to the
number of Cores per CPU times the number of physical CPU packages.
But with Hyper-Threading enabled, the indicated number of logical processors
is double the number of physical cores in a system.

The CPU-ID Name string is only displayed when supported by the CPU.
This name string is stored in the CPU and is usually programmed into the CPU
by the manufacturer or by the BIOS at boottime.


Error and Unknown messages
--------------------------
If CHKCPU32 is unable to detect the CPU Vendor you get an "Unknown" indication.
If CHKCPU32 is unable to detect the CPU Model you'll see -Unknown model-.
"Unknown" indications are also possible if CHKCPU32 is unable to detect the
L1, L2, or L3 cache size.

When CHKCPU32 detects a CPU without CPUID support, you will see:
 ERROR: This CPU is not supported by CHKCPU32. Use CHKCPU instead.
Note: If the /s or /f option is used, you only see: No CPUID
and if the /x option is used, the <cpuid_sign> member is zero, and all other
XML members showing CPU details are absent.

When CHKCPU32 detects a CPU with CPUID but without TSC support, you will see:
 Internal CPU speed  :  Unable to measure; No TSC
Note: If the /s or /f option is used, you only see: No TSC
and if the /x option is used, the <cpu_speed> member is zero.

If the speed measurement is aborted due very frequent Task-switching, you will
see: Internal CPU speed  : * Measurement unreliable due Task-switching *
Note: if the /x option is used, the <cpu_speed> member is zero in this case.
